# DreamArtist (webui Eextension)

Paper: [![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2211.11337-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11337)

This repo is the official ***Stable-Diffusion-webui extension version** implementation of ***"DreamArtist: Towards Controllable One-Shot Text-to-Image Generation via Contrastive Prompt-Tuning"*** 
with [Stable-Diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui).

Standalone version: [DreamArtist](https://github.com/7eu7d7/DreamArtist-stable-diffusion)

Everyone is an artist. Rome wasn't built in a day, but your artist dreams can be!

With just ***one*** training image DreamArtist learns the content and style in it, generating diverse high-quality images with high controllability.
Embeddings of DreamArtist can be easily combined with additional descriptions, as well as two learned embeddings.

# Setup and Running

Clone this repo to extension folder.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/7eu7d7/DreamArtist-sd-webui-extension.git extensions/DreamArtist
```

## Training and Usage

First create the positive and negative embeddings in ```DreamArtist Create Embedding``` Tab.
![](imgs/create.jpg)

### Preview Setting
After that, the ```names``` of the positive and negative embedding (```{name}``` and ```{name}-neg```) should be filled into the
```txt2img Tab``` with some common descriptions. This will ensure a correct preview image.
![](imgs/preview.png)

### Train
Then, select positive embedding and set the parameters and image folder path in the ```DreamArtist Train``` Tab to start training.
The corresponding negative embedding is loaded automatically.
If your VRAM is low or you want save time, you can uncheck the ```reconstruction```.

***better to train without filewords***

Remember to check the option below, otherwise the preview is wrong.

### Inference
Fill the trained positive and negative embedding into txt2img to generate with DreamArtist prompt.

### Attention Mask
Attention Mask can strengthen or weaken the learning intensity of some local areas. 
Attention Mask is a grayscale image whose grayscale values are related to the learning intensity show in the following table.

| grayscale | 0% | 25% | 50%  | 75%  | 100% |
|-----------|----|-----|------|------|------|
| intensity | 0% | 50% | 100% | 300% | 500% |

The Attention Mask is in the same folder as the training image and its name is the name of the training image + "_att".
You can choose whether to enable Attention Mask for training.

Since there is a self-attention operation in VAE, it may change the distribution of features. 
In the ***Process Att-Map*** tab, it can superimpose the attention map of self-attention on the original Att-Map.

### Dynamic CFG
Dynamic CFG can improve the performance, especially when the data set is large (>20). 
For example, linearly from 1.5 to 3.0 (1.5-3.0), or with a 0-π/2 cycle of cosine (1.5-3.0:cos), or with a -π/2-0 cycle of cosine (1.5-3.0:cos2).
Or you can also customize non-linear functions, such as 2.5-3.5:torch.sqrt(rate), where rate is a variable from 0-1.

## Tested models (need ema version):
+ Stable Diffusion v1.4
+ Stable Diffusion v1.5
+ animefull-latest
+ Anything v3.0
+ momoko-e

Embeddings can be transferred between different models of the same dataset.
